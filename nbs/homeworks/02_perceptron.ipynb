    "To build an intuition, we start with 2-dimensional data points. Start by sampling random points $\\mathbf{x}_n\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ in a plane within a finite range. Then, choose a random line in the plane as your target function $f$, where each side of the line belongs to a class, e.g., $f(\\mathbf{x})=\\pm 1$. Finally, generate the dataset $\\left\\{\\left(\\mathbf{x}_n,y_n\\right)\\right\\}$, with labels $y_n = f(\\mathbf{x}_n)$.\n",
